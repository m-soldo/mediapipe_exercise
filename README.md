# MediaPipe_Exercise
Tracking range of motion and number of repetitions for pullups, pushups and squats.

The human body is detected using mediapipe solutions from the mediapipe library. With applaience of mathematical methods, the algorithm is able to track how many repetitions of a given exercise were made and whether they were made with full range of motion (the algorithm won't count them otherwise).

Exercises covered so far are pullups, pushups and squats.
